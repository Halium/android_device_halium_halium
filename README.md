Device configuration for generic Halium 10 systemimage
=====================================================

This repository is used to build a generic systemimage for Halium-compatible
operating systems.


Building
--------

This is a "device tree", and as such it can be built by loosely following the
instructions at [docs.halium.org](https://docs.halium.org); please see that
page for a list of build dependencies and more explicative informations on each
of the build steps.

Assuming that you have all the build dependencies and the `repo` tool, you
should run the following commands:

    # Get all the needed repositories for a Halium-based build
    repo init -u https://github.com/Halium/android -b halium-10.0 --depth=1

A copy of this very repository will be created in
`device/halium/halium/`; if you are interested in trying out a
modification or branch, apply your changes in the repo located in that
directory before proceeding:

    # Get the required repositories for this specific build
    ./halium/devices/setup halium

    # Apply Halium patches to the Android source tree
    hybris-patches/apply-patches.sh --mb

    # Setup the build environment
    source build/envsetup.sh && breakfast halium_arm64 # Or halium_arm32, depending on your requirements

    # Build the raw system image
    mka rawsystemimage

After some time (depending on the machine you build on), the output will be in
`out/target/product/halium_arm64/android-rootfs.img` or if you built halium_arm32,
`out/target/product/halium_arm32/android-rootfs.img`

You can replace the android-rootfs.img via ssh:

    # Transfer android-rootfs.img to the device
    scp out/target/product/halium_arm64/android-rootfs.img phablet@10.15.19.82:/tmp/android-rootfs.img

    # Update android-rootfs.img
    ssh phablet@10.15.19.82 "sudo mount -o rw,remount /"
    ssh phablet@10.15.19.82 "sudo mv -v /tmp/android-rootfs.img /var/lib/lxc/android/android-rootfs.img"

    # Reboot the system to use the new android-rootfs.img
    ssh phablet@10.15.19.82 "sudo systemctl reboot"
